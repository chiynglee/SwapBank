< device probing >
1. dom0 (backend) : insmod shcomp_refer.ko
2. domU (frontend) : insmod shcomp_offer.ko
3. dom0 : ./1_probe.sh rshm {domU's id}

< device removing >
1. dom0 : ./2_close.sh rshm {domU's id}
2. dom0 : xenstore-ls (To see completion of the device closing)
	if this operation is completed, xenstore removes two directories 
	such as "/local/domain/rshm/device/{domU's id}/0" 
	and "/local/domain/0/backend/{domU's id}/rshm/0"

rmmod operation for backend dirver is not performed.
If it runs this operation, dom0 session does not response due to the "xenbus_unregister_driver()".
Althrough a new ssh session is available, the backend module is not unloaded.
